# Frontend
The frontend contains an Express.js app based on [this example](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html).

## Setup
Install Node.js through a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) (recommended) or through an [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run
```bash
npm install
```
in directory `frontend` once Node.js and `npm` have been installed.

## Running the server without Docker (for test purposes)
Navigate to directory `frontend` and start the app
```bash
cd convercode/frontend
npm start
```
Once the server starts, head to `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Running the server with Docker
Follow the instructions on the [simple-website-docker landing page](https://github.com/jessvb/simple-website-docker).
